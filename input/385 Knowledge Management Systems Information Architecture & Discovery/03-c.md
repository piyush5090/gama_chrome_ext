Slide 1
Title: What is Information Architecture? Core principles
Bullet points:
• Definition: Creating findable, learnable structure for content
• Primary goals: Help users find information efficiently and intuitively
• Blueprint for organizing information spaces like buildings
• Direct connection between IA quality and user experience
• Poor IA = invisible source of user frustration
• Good IA = feels seamless and natural to users
Image/Diagram: Split-screen illustration showing a confused user on the left navigating a poorly structured website with tangled pathways, contrasted with a confident user on the right moving smoothly through a well-organized information structure represented as clear, logical pathways

Slide 2
Title: The Four Pillars of Information Architecture
Bullet points:
• Organization: How content is grouped and structured (schemes and hierarchies)
• Labeling: How content is named and described (terminology and clarity)
• Navigation: How users move through information (pathways and wayfinding)
• Search: How users query and discover content (findability mechanisms)
• Four pillars work interdependently
• Weakness in one area affects overall system effectiveness
Image/Diagram: Classical temple structure with four pillars labeled Organization, Labeling, Navigation, and Search, supporting a roof labeled "Effective Information Architecture," with small icons representing each pillar's function

Slide 3
Title: Mental Models vs System Models
Bullet points:
• Mental models: How users think information should be organized
• Based on experience, knowledge, and expectations
• System models: How technology actually organizes information
• Gap between models creates usability problems
• IA goal: Minimize the gap between user and system thinking
• May require multiple organizational schemes simultaneously
Image/Diagram: Two brain icons side by side - one labeled "User Mental Model" showing organic, intuitive organization patterns, and one labeled "System Model" showing rigid, database-like structures, with arrows indicating the alignment process between them

Slide 4
Title: Understanding User Needs in IA
Bullet points:
• User research: Understanding goals, contexts, and skill levels
• Task analysis: Mapping steps users take to accomplish goals
• User journey mapping: Broader context of information-seeking
• Expert vs novice user needs and preferences
• Browsing vs searching behavior patterns
• Balancing multiple user types without creating barriers
Image/Diagram: User journey map showing different types of users (expert, novice, casual browser, focused searcher) with their respective pathways through an information system, highlighting different entry points and navigation patterns

Slide 5
Title: Content Models: From Atoms to Relationships
Bullet points:
• Content atoms: Smallest meaningful units (headlines, prices, dates)
• Content entities: Related groups of atoms forming complete units
• Relationships: Connections between entities that users navigate
• Scalable architectures: Designed for growth and adaptation
• Reusable components create consistency and efficiency
• Foundation for organization, labeling, and navigation decisions
Image/Diagram: Molecular-style diagram showing content atoms as small circles, connecting to form larger entity structures, with relationship lines between entities, building up to a complex but organized information architecture network
