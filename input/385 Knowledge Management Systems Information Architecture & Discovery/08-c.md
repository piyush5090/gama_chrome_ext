Slide 1
Title: KM System Components & Ecosystem Mapping
Bullet points:
• Catalog layer: Central registry of knowledge assets and metadata
• Search layer: Discovery engines and intelligent interfaces
• Content repository: Storage systems for multiple content types
• Collaboration layer: Knowledge sharing and co-creation tools
• Governance layer: Policies, workflows, and oversight mechanisms
• Interconnected architecture supporting seamless knowledge flow
Image/Diagram: Create a layered architecture diagram showing the five components as interconnected horizontal layers, with arrows indicating data flow and integration points between each layer. Use different colors for each layer and include small icons representing typical tools or functions within each layer.

Slide 2
Title: Requirements Analysis & Stakeholder Mapping
Bullet points:
• Knowledge workers: Diverse discovery needs and mental models
• Business units: Departmental vs cross-functional requirements
• Stakeholder influence mapping and competing priorities
• Functional and non-functional requirements gathering
• Observing actual vs stated knowledge-seeking behaviors
• Political dynamics and coalition building for change
Image/Diagram: Create a stakeholder mapping matrix with influence on one axis and interest/impact on the other. Include different personas (researchers, sales, legal, executives) positioned in different quadrants, with connecting lines showing relationships and potential conflicts between stakeholder groups.

Slide 3
Title: Information Governance: Policies & Compliance
Bullet points:
• Retention policies: Lifecycle rules for different content types
• Legal hold processes: Litigation and investigation preservation
• Classification schemes: Sensitivity levels and access controls
• Regulatory drivers: Privacy laws and industry standards
• Balancing business needs with legal obligations
• Compliance integration into everyday workflows
Image/Diagram: Create a governance framework diagram showing the flow from regulatory requirements through organizational policies to operational procedures. Include icons for different compliance standards (GDPR, SOX, HIPAA) feeding into a central governance engine that outputs specific policies and controls.

Slide 4
Title: Knowledge Lifecycle Management & Content Curation
Bullet points:
• Creation phase: Authoring standards and metadata capture
• Curation workflows: Editorial review and quality assurance
• Maintenance cycles: Updates, versioning, accuracy validation
• Archiving strategies: Long-term preservation and disposal
• Quality assurance mechanisms for trustworthy content
• Systematic review processes for relevance and accuracy
Image/Diagram: Create a circular lifecycle diagram showing the four phases (Creation, Curation, Maintenance, Archiving) with specific activities and decision points at each stage. Include feedback loops and quality gates between phases, with different colored paths for different content types or urgency levels.

Slide 5
Title: Change Management & Adoption Strategies
Bullet points:
• Communities of practice: Natural knowledge sharing networks
• Champion networks: Respected practitioners as change advocates
• Incentive mechanisms: Recognition and performance integration
• Adoption measurement: Usage, satisfaction, and quality metrics
• Resistance pattern analysis and response strategies
• Cultural transformation beyond technology implementation
Image/Diagram: Create a network diagram showing how communities of practice, champions, and incentives create interconnected support for adoption. Show nodes representing different user groups connected by various relationship types (mentoring, collaboration, influence) with different line styles and colors.

Slide 6
Title: Vendor & Technology Selection Criteria
Bullet points:
• Interoperability: System integration and open standards
• Metadata support: Taxonomy and ontology management
• Search capabilities: Semantic discovery and intelligent ranking
• Governance features: Workflow automation and policy enforcement
• Future flexibility vs current functionality balance
• API availability and vendor lock-in avoidance
Image/Diagram: Create a vendor evaluation matrix or scorecard template showing key criteria categories (Interoperability, Metadata, Search, Governance) with rating scales and weight indicators. Include a sample comparison of 3-4 hypothetical vendors to demonstrate how the evaluation framework would be applied in practice.
