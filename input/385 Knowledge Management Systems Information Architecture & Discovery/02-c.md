Slide 1
Title: What is Knowledge? Types and Models
• Data → Information → Knowledge → Wisdom hierarchy
• Tacit knowledge vs. explicit knowledge distinction
• Procedural, declarative, causal, and heuristic knowledge types
• Knowledge exists in people's minds and experiences
• Different forms serve different organizational purposes
Image/Diagram: A pyramid diagram showing the data-information-knowledge-wisdom hierarchy with arrows indicating transformation, and a side-by-side comparison illustration showing tacit knowledge (represented by a person with thought bubbles) versus explicit knowledge (represented by documents and databases)

Slide 2
Title: History & Evolution of Knowledge Management
• 1990s emergence from library sciences and corporate needs
• Knowledge economy shift from physical to intellectual assets
• Key milestones: early KM, social knowledge, enterprise systems
• Influential thinkers: Nonaka, Takeuchi, Davenport, Prusak
• Evolution through waves of technological advancement
Image/Diagram: A timeline visualization showing the evolution of knowledge management from the 1990s to present, with key milestones, influential figures, and technological developments marked along the timeline with connecting lines to brief descriptions

Slide 3
Title: KM Theories & Core Models
• SECI Model: Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization
• Knowledge lifecycle: creation → capture → organization → sharing → application
• Communities of practice as informal knowledge networks
• Knowledge conversion between tacit and explicit forms
• Practical frameworks for designing KM initiatives
Image/Diagram: A circular SECI model diagram with four quadrants showing the knowledge conversion processes, with arrows indicating the cyclical flow, and a separate linear diagram showing the knowledge lifecycle stages with connecting arrows and brief descriptions

Slide 4
Title: Knowledge Value & Strategic Role in Organizations
• Knowledge as primary source of competitive advantage
• Differentiation through expertise and application capabilities
• Knowledge assets requiring investment and maintenance
• Strategic alignment with business objectives
• Innovation, efficiency, risk reduction, and customer enhancement
Image/Diagram: A strategic framework diagram showing knowledge at the center with four connecting arrows pointing to competitive advantage outcomes: innovation, efficiency, risk reduction, and customer relationships, with brief examples under each category

Slide 5
Title: Organizational Learning & Cultural Enablers
• Psychological safety enables knowledge sharing behaviors
• Incentive systems must align with collaborative goals
• Barriers: silos, misaligned incentives, knowledge hoarding
• Leadership modeling and time allocation importance
• Cross-functional teams and communities of practice solutions
Image/Diagram: A culture transformation diagram showing barriers on the left (silos, fear, hoarding) with arrows pointing through enablers in the center (psychological safety, aligned incentives, leadership support) to positive outcomes on the right (sharing, collaboration, innovation)

Slide 6
Title: KM Governance, Policy & Roles
• Key roles: knowledge stewards, curators, and owners
• Policy frameworks: retention, classification, access guidelines
• Knowledge lifecycle management from creation to archival
• Governance structures enable scalability and sustainability
• Balance between sharing and security considerations
Image/Diagram: An organizational chart showing governance structure with knowledge owners at the top, knowledge stewards and curators in the middle, and knowledge users at the bottom, with policy framework boxes (retention, classification, access) connecting the different levels
