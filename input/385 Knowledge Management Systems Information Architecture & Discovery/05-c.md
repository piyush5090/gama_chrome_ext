Slide 1
Title: Metadata fundamentals: purpose & categories
Bullet points:
• Metadata as "data about data" - the invisible infrastructure of knowledge management
• Structural metadata: organization and formatting within systems
• Descriptive metadata: titles, subjects, summaries, and keywords
• Administrative metadata: technical details, permissions, lifecycle status
Image/Diagram: Create a visual diagram showing three interconnected circles labeled "Structural," "Descriptive," and "Administrative" with specific examples around each circle, demonstrating how they work together to describe a sample document

Slide 2
Title: Benefits for IA and discovery (findability, filtering, governance)
Bullet points:
• Findability enhancement through searchable attributes and content description
• Filtering capabilities for narrowing large content collections
• Governance support through tracking ownership and permissions
• Lifecycle management and content control
Image/Diagram: Design an infographic showing a content repository with three arrows pointing to different benefits - a magnifying glass for findability, filter funnel for filtering, and shield icon for governance, with example scenarios for each

Slide 3
Title: Designing taxonomies & classification schemes
Bullet points:
• Hierarchical taxonomies: tree-like structures with parent-child relationships
• Polyhierarchical taxonomies: items belonging to multiple categories
• Alignment with user mental models and natural categorization
• Balancing specificity with broad applicability
Image/Diagram: Create a side-by-side comparison showing a hierarchical taxonomy tree on the left and a polyhierarchical network structure on the right, using a business context example like organizational departments and projects

Slide 4
Title: Maintenance, versioning, stakeholder engagement
Bullet points:
• Ongoing maintenance strategies for keeping taxonomies current
• Version control approaches for managing taxonomy evolution
• Stakeholder engagement processes for input and adoption
• Change management for updating classification schemes
Image/Diagram: Illustrate a circular workflow diagram showing the continuous cycle of taxonomy maintenance: Review → Update → Engage → Implement → Monitor, with stakeholder icons around the periphery

Slide 5
Title: Thesauri, controlled vocabularies & synonym management
Bullet points:
• Purpose and structure of controlled vocabularies in knowledge management
• Preferred terms versus non-preferred terms and relationships
• Synonym management strategies for search and discovery
• Cross-references and related term relationships
Image/Diagram: Create a network diagram showing a central "preferred term" connected to multiple "non-preferred terms" and "related terms" with different types of connecting lines to show relationship types

Slide 6
Title: Handling synonyms, homonyms, ambiguity and language variants
Bullet points:
• Synonym challenges and term equivalence management strategies
• Homonym disambiguation techniques for clarifying context
• Managing ambiguity through scope notes and definitions
• Language variant considerations for multilingual differences
Image/Diagram: Design a visual showing the word "Java" in the center with three branches leading to different meanings (programming language, island, coffee) with context clues and scope notes for each interpretation

Slide 7
Title: Ontologies & formal knowledge modelling (theory)
Bullet points:
• Ontologies as formal representations of knowledge domains
• Classes, properties, and instances as building blocks
• Axioms and rules defining relationships and constraints
• Theoretical foundations for knowledge representation and reasoning
Image/Diagram: Create a conceptual diagram showing the relationship between Classes (rectangles), Properties (arrows), and Instances (circles) with a simple business example like Employee → "works on" → Project

Slide 8
Title: Differences between taxonomies, thesauri, and ontologies
Bullet points:
• Taxonomies: hierarchical classification with simple relationships
• Thesauri: vocabulary control tools with term relationships
• Ontologies: formal models with complex relationships and logic
• Use case scenarios for choosing appropriate systems
Image/Diagram: Design a comparison chart showing three columns with visual representations of each type - taxonomy as a tree, thesaurus as a web of connected terms, ontology as a formal logical structure with rules

Slide 9
Title: SKOS, RDF & metadata standards (conceptual)
Bullet points:
• SKOS for representing taxonomies and thesauri in digital formats
• RDF as foundation for semantic web technologies
• Dublin Core and metadata standards for interoperability
• Schema.org role in web-based knowledge representation
Image/Diagram: Create a layered architecture diagram showing how these standards build upon each other, with RDF at the base, SKOS and Dublin Core in the middle, and Schema.org applications at the top

Slide 10
Title: Why standards matter for enterprise discovery
Bullet points:
• Interoperability benefits across different systems and platforms
• Data exchange facilitation between internal and external sources
• Consistency in metadata application and interpretation
• Future-proofing knowledge assets through standardized approaches
Image/Diagram: Illustrate an enterprise ecosystem with different systems (CMS, Search, BI, External) connected through standardized metadata exchanges, showing seamless data flow

Slide 11
Title: Metadata governance, lifecycle & quality
Bullet points:
• Metadata stewardship roles and responsibilities
• Governance policies for creation, maintenance, and retirement
• Quality dimensions: completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness
• Lifecycle management from creation through archival
Image/Diagram: Create a governance framework diagram showing stewardship roles at the top, quality dimensions as pillars, and lifecycle stages as a timeline at the bottom

Slide 12
Title: Mapping metadata to business processes
Bullet points:
• Integration with existing business process workflows
• Natural touch points for metadata creation and updates
• Alignment with business objectives and user needs
• Process optimization to reduce burden while maximizing value
Image/Diagram: Design a business process flow diagram showing a typical workflow (document creation → review → approval → publication) with metadata capture points highlighted at each stage
