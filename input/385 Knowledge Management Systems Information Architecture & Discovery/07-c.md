Slide 1
Title: Search UX principles & mental models for discovery
Bullet points:
• Query affordances shape user expectations and search behavior
• Autocomplete and suggestions bridge user vocabulary gaps
• Different user intents require different interface patterns
• Mental models guide how users approach search tasks
Image/Diagram: Split-screen comparison showing a simple search box versus an advanced search interface with multiple input fields, dropdown menus, and filter options, illustrating different query affordances

Slide 2
Title: Results presentation & information scent
Bullet points:
• Ranking presentation influences user scanning and clicking patterns
• Snippets provide crucial context for click decisions
• Rich results can answer questions directly in search results
• Information scent theory explains user result selection behavior
Image/Diagram: Mock search results page showing different result formats - basic text snippets, rich snippets with ratings and images, and featured answer boxes, with arrows indicating user eye movement patterns

Slide 3
Title: Facets, filters, result clustering conceptual patterns
Bullet points:
• Faceted navigation enables progressive result refinement
• Filter design varies by content type and user needs
• Result clustering groups similar content automatically
• Each approach serves different discovery scenarios
Image/Diagram: Three-panel layout showing faceted search sidebar with checkboxes and categories, a product filter interface with sliders and dropdowns, and clustered search results grouped by topic with expandable sections

Slide 4
Title: Exploratory interfaces, faceted search & filters
Bullet points:
• Faceted navigation supports progressive disclosure of information
• Different content types benefit from different faceting approaches
• Filter design must balance power with cognitive load
• Exploratory search requires different patterns than targeted search
Image/Diagram: Interactive wireframe showing a faceted search interface for academic papers with collapsible sections for subject area, publication year, author, and methodology, with result counts updating as filters are applied

Slide 5
Title: Personalization & contextualization theory
Bullet points:
• Session, user profile, and task context enable personalization
• Ethical considerations around filter bubbles and bias
• Tension between efficiency and serendipitous discovery
• User control and transparency in personalized systems
Image/Diagram: Flowchart showing how different types of user data (session history, profile data, current task) feed into a personalization engine that influences search ranking and recommendation algorithms

Slide 6
Title: Conversational discovery & question answering
Bullet points:
• Natural language interfaces support interactive information seeking
• Multi-turn conversations maintain context across interactions
• User expectations differ from traditional search paradigms
• Fallback strategies needed when conversation breaks down
Image/Diagram: Chat interface mockup showing a multi-turn conversation about research topics, with the system asking clarifying questions and providing progressively more specific results based on user responses

Slide 7
Title: Accessibility & inclusive design for discovery
Bullet points:
• Accessible design principles benefit all users
• ARIA, clear content, and keyboard navigation foundations
• Multiple interaction modalities support diverse needs
• Cultural and literacy considerations in interface design
Image/Diagram: Side-by-side comparison of the same search interface showing accessibility features - keyboard focus indicators, screen reader annotations, high contrast mode, and simplified language options
