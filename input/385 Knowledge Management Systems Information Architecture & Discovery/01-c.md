Slide 1
Title: Course Introduction & Objectives
Bullet points:
• Knowledge Management Systems: frameworks for organizational intelligence
• Information Architecture: organizing information for findability
• Discovery: processes and interfaces for information retrieval
• Theoretical focus building analytical frameworks
• Applications across diverse organizational contexts
Image/Diagram: Create a Venn diagram showing the intersection of Knowledge Management, Information Architecture, and Discovery, with "Organizational Success" at the center where all three overlap

Slide 2
Title: Learning Outcomes & Course Structure
Bullet points:
• Analyze knowledge management challenges systematically
• Design information architectures that enhance findability
• Create discovery experiences for diverse user needs
• 14 progressive sections from foundations to applications
• Integration of concepts across disciplines
Image/Diagram: Create a learning pathway visualization showing 14 connected nodes representing course sections, with arrows indicating progression from foundational concepts to advanced applications

Slide 3
Title: How to Learn from This Course
Bullet points:
• Active engagement with concepts over passive consumption
• Connect theory to personal and organizational examples
• Use reflection opportunities to deepen understanding
• Transform content into personal study materials
• Create visual summaries and concept maps
Image/Diagram: Design an infographic showing effective learning strategies with icons for note-taking, reflection, concept mapping, and real-world application

Slide 4
Title: Assessment & Checkpoints
Bullet points:
• Structured thinking exercises throughout the course
• Reflective prompts at key transition points
• Self-assessment opportunities for understanding
• Theoretical capstone design project
• Focus on systematic thinking over technical solutions
Image/Diagram: Create a timeline graphic showing assessment touchpoints throughout the course, with icons representing different types of reflection and assessment activities

Slide 5
Title: Key Concepts & Terminology Map
Bullet points:
• Knowledge hierarchy: Data → Information → Knowledge → Wisdom
• Information Architecture: structural design of information environments
• Discovery: purposeful search and serendipitous browsing
• Search: specific type of discovery process
• Metadata: structured data describing other data
Image/Diagram: Design a comprehensive concept map showing the relationships between all key terms, with the knowledge hierarchy as a vertical foundation and other concepts branching horizontally with connecting lines showing relationships
