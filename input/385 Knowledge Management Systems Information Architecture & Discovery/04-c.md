Slide 1
Title: What is Discovery? Definitions & User Goals
Bullet points:
• Discovery vs Search vs Browsing distinctions
• Exploratory search characteristics and applications
• User intent variations in discovery contexts
• Open-ended vs targeted information seeking
Image/Diagram: Create a visual diagram showing three interconnected circles labeled "Search," "Discovery," and "Browsing" with arrows indicating the relationships and flow between them, including example scenarios for each type

Slide 2
Title: Common Discovery Tasks: Fact Lookup, Exploratory Research, Serendipity
Bullet points:
• Fact lookup: direct, specific information seeking
• Exploratory research: comprehensive topic investigation
• Serendipitous discovery: unexpected valuable findings
• Task complexity and system design implications
Image/Diagram: Design an infographic showing three distinct pathways representing each discovery task type, with icons and examples showing the different user journeys and outcomes for fact lookup, exploration, and serendipity

Slide 3
Title: Theories of Relevance & Information-Seeking Behavior
Bullet points:
• Relevance dimensions: topical, situational, task-based
• Kuhlthau's Information Search Process stages
• Belkin's Anomalous State of Knowledge theory
• User uncertainty and information need evolution
Image/Diagram: Create a multi-layered diagram showing the three dimensions of relevance as overlapping circles, with Kuhlthau's process stages shown as a timeline below, and Belkin's knowledge gap concept illustrated with before/after states

Slide 4
Title: How Users Formulate Queries and Refine Them Conceptually
Bullet points:
• Initial query formulation strategies and limitations
• Query refinement patterns and behaviors
• Mental model evolution during search process
• Vocabulary learning and adaptation
Image/Diagram: Design a flowchart showing the iterative query refinement process, with branches showing different refinement strategies (add terms, remove terms, substitute synonyms, reframe approach) and feedback loops

Slide 5
Title: Information Retrieval Models (Conceptual Overview)
Bullet points:
• Boolean retrieval model fundamentals
• Vector space model concepts and similarity
• Probabilistic and language modeling approaches
• Matching precision and flexibility tradeoffs
Image/Diagram: Create a visual comparison showing three panels: Boolean logic with Venn diagrams, vector space with geometric representations of documents and queries, and probabilistic models with probability distributions

Slide 6
Title: Tradeoffs: Precision vs Recall, Ranking vs Filtering
Bullet points:
• Precision vs recall balance in system design
• Task-dependent optimal balance points
• Ranking mechanisms and relevance ordering
• Filtering approaches and user control options
Image/Diagram: Design a 2x2 matrix showing precision vs recall quadrants with examples, plus a side comparison of ranking (ordered list) vs filtering (funnel) approaches with visual metaphors

Slide 7
Title: Indexing Concepts & Document Representations
Bullet points:
• Conceptual purpose and benefits of indexing
• Tokenization, normalization, and preprocessing
• TF-IDF weighting scheme fundamentals
• Efficiency vs comprehensiveness considerations
Image/Diagram: Create a step-by-step visual process showing document → tokenization → normalization → indexing → searchable structure, with examples at each stage and a TF-IDF calculation illustration

Slide 8
Title: Document vs. Metadata Representation and Tradeoffs
Bullet points:
• Full-text representation benefits and limitations
• Metadata-based approaches and controlled vocabulary
• Hybrid strategies combining both approaches
• Resource allocation and strategic decisions
Image/Diagram: Design a comparison chart showing two document representation approaches side-by-side with pros/cons lists, plus a hybrid model in the center showing how both approaches can be combined effectively
