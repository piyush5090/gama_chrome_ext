Slide 1
Title: Course Overview and Structure
• Web3 Economics Mastery: tokenomics, DAOs, decentralized business models
• 8 comprehensive sections: foundations to future trends
• Progressive journey from basic concepts to advanced applications
• Structured learning path with practical focus
Image/Diagram: A flowchart showing the 8 course sections connected with arrows, displaying the logical progression from Web3 foundations through tokenomics, DAOs, business models, intersections, risks/regulation, to future trends

Slide 2
Title: Learning Objectives and Outcomes
• Master tokenomics design principles and valuation frameworks
• Understand DAO governance models and operational challenges
• Analyze decentralized business models across industries
• Develop practical skills for Web3 economic decision-making
Image/Diagram: Three interconnected circles representing the main learning outcomes (Tokenomics, DAOs, Business Models) with icons and brief descriptors for each area

Slide 3
Title: Why Theory and Frameworks Matter
• Cost of poor design: Terra Luna collapse, unsustainable reward loops
• Theoretical understanding prevents common pitfalls
• Framework-based decision making in volatile markets
• Mental models for navigating complexity
Image/Diagram: A split-screen comparison showing "Failed Projects" on the left (with examples like Terra Luna) and "Framework-Based Success" on the right, connected by arrows showing cause and effect

Slide 4
Title: What You'll Achieve by Course End
• Evaluate and design sustainable token economies
• Participate in or create effective DAOs
• Build or assess decentralized business models
• Navigate Web3 opportunities with confidence
