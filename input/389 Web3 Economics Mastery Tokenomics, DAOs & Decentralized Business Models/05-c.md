Slide 1
Title: What Are Tokens?
Bullet points:
• Programmable representations of value, rights, and access
• Digital containers enforcing rules through smart contracts
• Operate on decentralized networks without intermediaries
• Enable peer-to-peer value transfer and new economic models
Image/Diagram: Create a visual showing interconnected digital tokens as building blocks, with arrows indicating programmable functions like access rights, value transfer, and automated rules execution

Slide 2
Title: Difference Between Coins and Tokens
Bullet points:
• Coins: Native currencies of their own blockchains (Bitcoin, Ether)
• Tokens: Built on existing blockchain infrastructure
• Coins pay gas fees and secure networks
• Tokens inherit security while adding unique economic properties
Image/Diagram: Design a comparison diagram showing Bitcoin/Ethereum as coins at the foundation layer, with various tokens built on top of Ethereum, connected by lines showing dependency relationships

Slide 3
Title: Token Categories: Utility Tokens
Bullet points:
• Provide access to network services and features
• Examples: Chainlink LINK, Basic Attention Token BAT
• Function as digital keys unlocking protocol functionality
• Value grows with network adoption and usage
Image/Diagram: Create an infographic showing utility tokens as keys unlocking different services - LINK unlocking oracle data, BAT unlocking ad rewards, with usage flow arrows

Slide 4
Title: Token Categories: Governance Tokens
Bullet points:
• Grant voting rights in protocol decision-making
• Examples: Uniswap UNI, MakerDAO MKR
• Enable democratic participation in protocol evolution
• Align community interests with protocol success
Image/Diagram: Design a governance visualization showing token holders voting on protocol proposals, with voting weight represented by token holdings, leading to implemented changes

Slide 5
Title: Token Categories: Security Tokens
Bullet points:
• Represent ownership in real-world assets
• Regulatory compliant with investor protections
• Bridge traditional finance and blockchain technology
• Enable fractional ownership and global trading
Image/Diagram: Create a visual showing traditional assets (real estate, stocks, commodities) being tokenized into blockchain representations, with regulatory compliance badges

Slide 6
Title: Token Categories: Stablecoins
Bullet points:
• Maintain price stability through various mechanisms
• Fiat-backed (USDC), crypto-collateralized (DAI), algorithmic
• Serve as medium of exchange in DeFi protocols
• Essential infrastructure for Web3 commerce
Image/Diagram: Design a stability mechanism diagram showing different stablecoin types with their backing methods and price stabilization arrows pointing to $1.00 peg

Slide 7
Title: Token Categories: NFTs and Hybrids
Bullet points:
• NFTs represent unique, non-interchangeable digital assets
• Applications beyond art: gaming, membership, identity
• Hybrid tokens combine multiple properties and functions
• Evolution toward sophisticated multi-functional designs
Image/Diagram: Create a visualization showing NFT uniqueness with distinct visual elements, and hybrid tokens displaying multiple overlapping function circles (governance + utility + ownership)

Slide 8
Title: Tokens as the Atomic Unit of Web3 Economics
Bullet points:
• Basic building blocks of decentralized economic systems
• Programmable logic encoded directly into token design
• Enable composability between different protocols
• Coordinate incentives across global networks automatically
Image/Diagram: Design an atomic structure metaphor with tokens as atoms connecting to form complex molecular structures representing different DeFi protocols, with composability bonds between them
