Slide 1
Title: Decentralization as the Foundation
Bullet points:
• Definition: Distributing power, control, and economic value away from central authorities
• Technical decentralization vs governance decentralization
• Contrast with traditional centralized systems (banks, platforms, governments)
• Eliminates single points of failure and control
• Enables new economic models impossible under centralization
Image/Diagram: A visual comparison showing centralized vs decentralized network structures - one showing a hub-and-spoke model with a central authority connected to many users, and another showing a mesh network where users are interconnected peer-to-peer

Slide 2
Title: Transparency and Its Economic Implications
Bullet points:
• Open-source protocols with verifiable code
• Public ledgers enable real-time auditability
• Creates "perfect information" reducing market inefficiencies
• Eliminates information asymmetries between parties
• Enables new forms of economic coordination and accountability
Image/Diagram: A layered diagram showing traditional "black box" systems vs transparent blockchain systems, with arrows showing how information flows differently in each model, highlighting visibility of transactions, smart contracts, and governance decisions

Slide 3
Title: Immutability and Economic Certainty
Bullet points:
• Permanent, unchangeable records on blockchain
• Provides "credible commitment" to economic rules
• Reduces regulatory risk and enables long-term planning
• Trade-off between certainty and adaptability
• Foundation for trustworthy economic agreements
Image/Diagram: A timeline graphic showing how traditional systems can change rules arbitrarily vs blockchain systems with locked-in smart contract rules, including visual representations of contract modifications and their difficulty levels

Slide 4
Title: Composability - The Lego Blocks of Web3
Bullet points:
• Protocols as interoperable building blocks
• Contrast with Web2 walled gardens
• Exponential network effects through combination
• Accelerates innovation and reduces development costs
• DeFi as prime example of composability in action
Image/Diagram: A Lego-style building block diagram showing how different DeFi protocols (Uniswap, Aave, Yearn) can be stacked and connected, with arrows showing value and data flows between components

Slide 5
Title: Trustless Systems and Peer-to-Peer Economics
Bullet points:
• Minimizing trust through cryptographic proof
• Smart contracts as automatic enforcement mechanisms
• Eliminates counterparty risk in economic relationships
• Enables global, permissionless participation
• Reduces dependence on intermediaries and institutions
Image/Diagram: A before/after comparison showing traditional trust-based transactions (with banks, lawyers, escrow services) vs smart contract-based transactions with automated execution and verification

Slide 6
Title: From Consumers to Stakeholders
Bullet points:
• Web2: Users provide value but don't share economic upside
• Web3: Ownership economy where users become stakeholders
• Token ownership aligns platform and user incentives
• Users as investors, contributors, and governance participants
• Reshapes digital labor and value creation models
Image/Diagram: A transformation graphic showing the evolution from Web2 extraction model (platform takes all value) to Web3 sharing model (users receive tokens and ownership), with visual representations of value flows and stakeholder relationships
