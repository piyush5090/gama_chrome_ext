Slide 1
Title: How blockchains enable decentralized economic activity
Bullet points:
• Traditional systems rely on centralized intermediaries (banks, governments)
• Blockchains create peer-to-peer economic networks
• Distributed ledger enables direct value transfer
• Immutability and transparency build systemic trust

Slide 2
Title: Consensus mechanisms in economic terms
Bullet points:
• Proof of Work: Mining rewards and energy costs create economic incentives
• Proof of Stake: Validators stake tokens, aligning economic interests
• Hybrid models optimize for efficiency, security, and scalability
• Economic security through cryptographic and financial mechanisms

Slide 3
Title: The role of smart contracts in automating trust
Bullet points:
• Eliminate trusted third parties in economic agreements
• Programmable money enables automatic execution
• Reduced transaction costs and settlement times
• Real-world applications in DeFi, DAOs, and automated finance
